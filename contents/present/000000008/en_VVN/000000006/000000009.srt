00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,800
So we're coming near the end of our course now, but we've got a couple of more sections to go.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,370
And I just want to end off by showing you a way to authenticate who is sending your message, and it

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,900
uses RSA.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
So we call this signatures or digital signatures.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,540
And if I go to our notes, in fact, I'm not asking you to write anything in for this part.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm just going to explain the method.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:34,350
So the intention of RSA is to in cipher using your value e and then decipher using the value D but in

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,290
fact the rows of E and D are interchangeable.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,560
You could in fact and cipher your message using the value D and then decipher the message using the

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,240
value B if you wanted to.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,380
This has a very important function in authenticating messages, so consider two correspondence.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,700
John and Mary, I think I want you to give Alice and Bob a day off.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,790
So John and Mary are sending each of the messages, each have their own public key, which are known

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,800
to everyone, and each have their own private key known only to themselves.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's say Mary's public key is giving you some values.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:27,210
E is 8023 modulus 24,257 and John's Public Key E 8993 and a modulus of 11,435.

17
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,950
These are this is the public information.

18
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,400
Now, John is going to send a message and it says, meet you at six, John.

19
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,880
So he signs off with his name that John and written in blocks we might break this up into blocks remember

20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,730
that prevents frequency analysis so I've broken it open two blocks of two there so we've got meet you

21
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:54,780
at six John or in numbers I now turn those into numbers like that so we get these blocks of numbers.

22
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,460
The last two of those blocks, the last well, eight digits is the signature, John.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,420
Now, how can Mary know that?

24
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,770
The message really is from John?

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:18,030
One way is for John to use his private key John and ciphers his signature using his private key so that

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,240
it reads this value like these numbers here.

27
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,970
So now we have this message.

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:33,660
But John has insisted the signature at the end using his private key John now in ciphers that message

29
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,880
using Mary's public key.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,850
So now takes all of that including his signature at the end and in cipher is that with Mary's public

31
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,520
key then sends it to Mary.

32
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:54,660
Mary receives the message she will then decrypted using her private key to produce this message.

33
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,000
And Mary will then extract that last bit at the end the signature.

34
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:09,390
And knowing that the message is supposed to be from John, Mary applies John's public key to his signature

35
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,460
to get these values here.

36
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,190
So Mary is now decrypting that bit at the end, using John's public key.

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,120
Finally putting all this together, Mary will get the message.

38
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,010
Meet you at six, John.

39
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,330
And the only one who could have made that possible is John himself.

40
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:36,540
The only person who could have encrypted that signature at the end with John's private key is John himself.

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,890
That is the idea.

42
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:46,260
Note, though, just like before with RSA, it is more secure to use different RSA keys for encryption

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,920
and signing.

44
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,720
So you might have to RSA.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,910
He's going on and you will still need padding and breaking open the blocks and all those things.

46
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,920
We need to prevent people from stealing our messages using RSA.

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,110
Yes, padding should be used for message signing as it is for message encryption.

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,640
Okay, so that's a really clever idea and that's all I wanted to say about signatures, but a really

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,040
clever way of using RSA.

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,960
Now we really are getting near the end and that's the end of public key cryptography.

51
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:29,670
And then just as the very last thing, I want you to take a brief look at the future of cryptography.

52
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,380
So one more video.

53
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,060
I'm going to have a look at the future.
