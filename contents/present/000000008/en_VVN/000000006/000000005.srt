1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,270
Now that we have these mathematical results, we should be ready to have a look at RSA decryption.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,660
So let's take notes and here we go.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,590
So RSA decryption here is going to be using Fermat's Little Theorem and the Chinese remainder theorem.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,370
So first we're going to recall the RSA set up.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,080
If you remember how we set up our RSA, there were two primes, Q1 and Q2.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,490
That's right.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:26,880
But in.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,140
So we got Q1, Q2 primes.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,060
We got a modulus M, which is equal to Q one times Q two.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:45,720
We have this thing called A, which is equal to Q one minus one in brackets multiplied by Q two minus

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,110
one.

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:56,460
And we had E, which was our encryption key, and that is an integer K prime to A that is the RSA setup.

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:07,230
Now there is a decryption key where kind of equality for decryption such that x to the power e times

14
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:18,090
d is congruent to x mark m so I claim it exists a decryption key that would return you back to your

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,930
original value.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,750
Nice for all integers x.

17
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,460
The decryption key is the multiplicative inverse of E modulo a.

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:44,630
And I e e times d is congruent to one mod a so yes, that's actually rather surprising because mod a

19
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,740
coming out here now instead of being a mod Q mod A Yeah.

20
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,960
The decryption key is the multiplicative inverse of E modulo a Well, I have to prove this, so let's

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,470
do that.

22
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,730
Here is our proof.

23
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:11,070
So if we have E and a CO prime which is part of the set up, if in A-OK prime, then warning bells e

24
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:20,370
and a co prime means we can do this s times e plus t time a equals one.

25
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,720
Yes, absolutely.

26
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:39,680
Equivalently, then we're saying s e is congruent to one mod a s because there's t a is a multiple of

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,760
A that disappears.

28
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:51,170
So we've got a 1 to 1 mod a therefore the multiplicative inverse of E modulo a is s.

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,720
It's that coefficient there in front of the E and let's let D decryption key equal s.

30
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,420
So this exists.

31
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,550
We know it exists because of what we've just said.

32
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,870
So this exists.

33
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:21,620
But does it decode messages to show that x to the power e d congruent to x mod m for all integers x.

34
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:29,120
What we're going to do is first we're going to prove that that is true in mod q one and we're going

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,610
to show is true in Mod Q two.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,380
Then you can use the Chinese remainder theorem, which would then prove that it is true in modulo m,

37
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,000
which I might I'll write this here, which is Q one times Q two.

38
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,400
So let's break this down and prove its true in March.

39
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,880
Q one.

40
00:03:53,230 --> 00:04:07,690
Well, first, if Q one divides X, then x is congruent to zero mod q one because x would be a multiple

41
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,410
of Q one.

42
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:21,490
But similarly x to the power it would be congruent to well, zero to the power which is zero.

43
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,280
And in March.

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,730
Q one.

45
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:42,840
So not very controversial to say in that case X to the power Eddie is congruent to x mod q10 is congruent

46
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,910
to zero we're saying there, but that is if xq1 divide x on the other hand, if Q one does not divide

47
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,270
x.

48
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:00,100
If Q one does not divide X, then we're going to use firm Arsenal theorem, Fermat's Little Theorem.

49
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:08,200
Okay, so one thing we're going to need first X to the power A and I'm interested in what that is equal

50
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,650
to.

51
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,660
And so X to the power.

52
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,550
A What is a what?

53
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,970
It's.

54
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,880
Q One minus one.

55
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,630
Multiply by Q two minus one.

56
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,040
So I'm going to put X to the power.

57
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,760
Q One minus one in a bracket, and then that's to the power.

58
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,610
Q Two minus one.

59
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,270
And that's because A is multiplying those two things together.

60
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,850
And in March.

61
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,610
Q One, I'm going to write on the far right hand side here.

62
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:37,990
Mar.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,620
Q One just to remind us where we are in March.

64
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,000
Q One arithmetic.

65
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,940
We can use a thin central theorem here, so we've got an integer to the power prime minus one that becomes

66
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,710
a one in the bracket, and that is to the power.

67
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,140
Q Two minus one.

68
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,000
So that has changed into a one from Fair Master to seven.

69
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,240
And now we've got one to the power of something, which is one.

70
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,760
Okay.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,920
So X and power A is congruent to one might.

72
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,510
Q one.

73
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,360
And now, since we know that e times D is equal to.

74
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,400
Okay.

75
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,690
A plus one.

76
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:33,210
In other words, e times d y where inverses of each other, which means we get this formula.

77
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,370
Then for some integer k we have.

78
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,810
Ex to the power, Eddie.

79
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,630
I wonder what's going to happen.

80
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,540
When it's congruent to x to the power k a plus one.

81
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,600
Yeah.

82
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,520
Which is congruent to.

83
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:07,890
If I break up that calculation, that would be X to the power A in a bracket to the power k.

84
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,030
And then multiply by X.

85
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,830
I say, Congressman, these are equal so far, all those are equal.

86
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,470
And then this is congruent to and this is where we can perform a substitution.

87
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:29,670
So again, in mod q one arithmetic, so I'm right in the right hand side, that bracket we can replace

88
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,730
with the previous line X to the power is congruent to one.

89
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:41,550
So that bracket is a one to the power K multiplied by x and that is congruent to one to the power case

90
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,130
one and multiply by x, so congruent to x.

91
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,470
And that is what I was trying to show.

92
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:58,490
Either way, we have this little congruence that I was trying to prove is true in Mod Q one and by the

93
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,480
completely, completely the same argument, it's going to be true in mod q to as well.

94
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,950
I don't actually have to say that argument again, because it's exactly the same.

95
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,320
It's just using one prime number instead of another.

96
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,150
So it's true in mod q one and it will be true in mod q two.

97
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,680
And since they are both prime, so since Q1 and Q2 of a prime, we're going to use our Chinese remainder

98
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,340
theorem, which means it's now true in mod m.

99
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,510
Which is equal to Q1 times Q2.

100
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,760
End of proof.

101
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,360
And.

102
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,790
Yes.

103
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,840
Okay.

104
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,960
I mean, you you'll need a moment to absorb this interview.

105
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,720
If you don't get it all straight away, I wouldn't expect you to.

106
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,450
But that should all be true.

107
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,070
If you take a moment to read back over it and absorb it in your own time.

108
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,070
That should all be true and working.

109
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,570
So we have a decryption method.

110
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:08,030
The decryption key is the multiplicative inverse of E and modulo a actually a decryption key.

111
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:15,080
In other words, if you want to find your decryption key, it is the coefficient of e in something like

112
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:21,530
s e plus t a equals one.

113
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,430
And how would you find this?

114
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,730
So we're looking for this s here.

115
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,890
The coefficient in front of E.

116
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,680
How would you find it?

117
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,980
You might just notice it if you are using small numbers.

118
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,420
If you notice, it's fine.

119
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,110
Great.

120
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,050
But otherwise you could use Euclid's algorithm.

121
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:43,100
Going back to the things we did in section one, the multiplicative ciphers.

122
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:52,910
You would use Euclid's algorithm so that you could write one as a combination of E and A, with that

123
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,360
coefficient being the value we are after for decryption.

124
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:04,640
So hopefully you can see that all that hard work we did in Section one was really laying the foundations

125
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,260
to set us up for this section.

126
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,330
Now here at the end.

127
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,620
So let's do an example of a decryption.

128
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:21,870
So let's have a equals four and E equals three as a bush.

129
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:29,790
So we're just using the example we had before when I encrypted a message with RSA and to remind you

130
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,180
A was for E equals three then.

131
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:40,680
Right, I need to write one as a combination of this you could use you create algorithm, although that

132
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,330
is those are small numbers.

133
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:56,970
So I think I could just notice that seven times three is 21 plus minus five times four is -20 is equal

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,750
to one.

135
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:05,400
So I might just notice that and go write this coefficient here in front of three is the decryption key

136
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,280
so we can use D equal seven.

137
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,770
I equal seven as our decryption key.

138
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:22,760
So we had the example before where I in cipher the message and the cipher turned out to be 107466.

139
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,980
And then you will hit that cipher with our decryption formula.

140
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,210
P is equal to C to the power d.

141
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,340
Okay, let's do that at seven.

142
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,600
So one to the power seven is one zero to the power seven is zero seven to the power seven.

143
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,520
Now it starts getting large.

144
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:54,840
And yeah, if you wanted to do this pen and paper by hand, you could break it up and find clever ways

145
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,160
of making parts of the calculation smaller or get a computer to do it.

146
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:04,410
And I am just going to laboriously write out what it is.

147
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:10,020
It's 823,543.

148
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,400
Now we'll go on to our next number four to the power seven.

149
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:21,690
Now, the big number, 16,384, six to the power seven.

150
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,310
Another big number, 279,000

151
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,980
279,936.

152
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,900
And we're going to get the same again here.

153
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,920
279,936.

154
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,670
Right.

155
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,150
Modulo M and which is right back in the gap.

156
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,110
Modulo M.

157
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,540
So we're going to divide now by our modulus.

158
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,340
And in this small example, our modulus was ten.

159
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,770
Going back to our previous example.

160
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,800
So we divided by ten looking for the remainder, which is 103466.

161
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,450
Turn it back into letters.

162
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,980
You get the original message.

163
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,990
That egg that we had before and I say it will decrypt our message.

164
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,290
I will point something out here in the sentence underneath.

165
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:19,030
Notice I could have used a d equals three here as my decryption key.

166
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:29,230
And I could have I could have done this three times three is nine plus minus two times four is minus

167
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,640
eight, and that is equal to one.

168
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:39,730
So those are my values of eight and a three and four and the coefficient that is three in front of the

169
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,450
encryption key.

170
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:47,290
I just didn't want you to think that the encryption key and the decryption key D had to be the same

171
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,020
because in that small example there, the encryption and decryption key are both three.

172
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,610
That is not true in general.

173
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,230
That's why I kind of did it in a slightly different way here, just to make that point.

174
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,460
So there you have it and decryption keys.

175
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:13,330
And in practice, however, RSA is a relatively slow algorithm, so it is very used to encrypt plain

176
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,250
text messages directly.

177
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:24,090
So what I've shown you here is me and Cipher in a message using RSA, which is known as textbook RSA,

178
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,020
how, how you teach RSA, but you wouldn't actually use it in this way.

179
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:36,850
Instead, RSA is used to encrypt keys, so you can exchange keys with each other, and then you can

180
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,550
then have the key to use in whatever cipher you want to use the key in.

181
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,290
So you could use it in some sort of simpler cipher after that.

182
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,080
So in practice, I always say it's just another way of exchanging keys.

183
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,030
Right.

184
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,970
So that is encryption and decryption of RSA.

185
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,730
But we will be moving on next to breaking RSA.

186
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,380
Now, imagine you're the bad person here wanting to break one of these messages.

187
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,980
We're going to show you how hard it is to break RSA.
