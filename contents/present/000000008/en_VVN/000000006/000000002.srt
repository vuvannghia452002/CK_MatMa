1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,590
Now it's time to take a look at the solutions for the TV helmet exercises.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,260
So I've asked that you try and calculate these consequences without a calculator.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,490
So do hope you did try that.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,870
Question one says Calculate the lowest positive value of three to power for mod 80.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:27,660
So if I write three to the power for that is equal to or counting to 81 which is congruent to one mod

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,290
eight six fairly simple to start with be use your answer to the above to show that three to the power

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,340
316 is coming to one mod 80.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,610
So we can break down three to the power 360.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,780
It's three to the power, four to the power 79.

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,680
And that is congruent to now we replace the three to the power four with one and that is to the power

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,460
79, and that is congruent to at one mod 80.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,050
There you go.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,600
That is the end of the proof question to show that forward to the power five and plus one is to zero

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,650
mod 1024 for all integers.

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,250
N.

16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,930
So let's try that.

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:24,390
Well, we start by observing that 4 to 2 power five is 1024, which is congruent to zero mod 1 to 4.

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,920
So if we're interested in four to the power five and plus one, we can break that down and we can write

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,810
as four to the power, five to the power n multiplied by four.

20
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,980
And that is congruent to well the bracket gets replaced with a zero to the power end times four and

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,960
that is coming to zero times four.

22
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,780
That is zero in mod 1 to 4 and that's always true for any integer n.

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:00,210
Question three Calculate 11 to the power and Model 101 for these values of DN two, three, four, five

24
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,960
and ten.

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,980
So let's do that.

26
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,950
Let's start with 11 squared.

27
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,030
So 11 squared is equal to 121.

28
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,660
Nice.

29
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,100
Congruent to 20.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,260
In mod 101.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,790
Now we look at the next power it having cubed.

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,420
Well we can use the answer we've had before so we can look at 11 squared and then multiply that by 11,

33
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:33,650
replacing the 11 squared with 20 and then multiply that by 11 we get 220 and that is congruent to 18

34
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,150
MOD 101.

35
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,360
If we go to the next power and even to the power four, you could break that up in many different ways.

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,700
I'm going to have a look at 11 squared.

37
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,420
Squared.

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:55,600
So if that is congruent to replace the bracket with 20 and then we'll square that, that will give us

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,830
400.

40
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,680
And in this, we'll get 97 MOD 101.

41
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,800
And if we look at 11 to the power five, again, you can break this up in many different ways.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,740
I'm going to look at 11 squared times.

43
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,520
11 cubed.

44
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,090
11 squared can be replaced with 2011 cubed can be replaced with 18.

45
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,730
So we get 360.

46
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,710
And that is congruent to 57.

47
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,610
Mod 101.

48
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,140
And finally, we're looking at 11 to the power ten.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,990
Again, you can break that up in many ways.

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,670
What I've done is Dr. 11 to the powerful square that to get 11 to the power eight and then multiply

51
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,930
by 11 squared and that is congruent to what 11 to power for it was 97.

52
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,610
But I'm going to actually write that as minus four, because that's going to make my life easier.

53
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,650
And that becomes squared.

54
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,810
And then multiply that by 11 squared, which becomes 20.

55
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,870
So we're going to get 16 times 20.

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:19,310
16 times 20, which is 320, and then that is congruent to 17 MOD 101.

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,980
So it is a little bit of a scale, but you can actually do these calculations by hand.

58
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,260
Now let's take a look at question four.

59
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,000
So here is question four.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,780
And we're going to use Steffi Howe in key exchange to create a shared key.

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,810
We've got a generator X equal to 11 and a modulus Q equal to 101.

62
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,260
So first of all, we're going to create Alice's shared key.

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,950
So if Alice's secret integer is a equals 13, calculate X to the power aid mode.

64
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,950
Q So we're looking at 11 to the power.

65
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:02,490
A So that is to the power 13 in Mod 101 so we can use the answers we've already worked out to help us

66
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:02,940
out here.

67
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:10,980
So that's could be written as 11 to the power, ten times 11 cubed or any other way that you want to

68
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,370
do it.

69
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,640
But 11 to the power, ten is 17.

70
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,790
11, Kate becomes 18.

71
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,330
And then you can calculate that it's 306.

72
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,500
Which is congruent to three mod one I want.

73
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,280
Now we look at Bob's part of this.

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,750
Bob's secret integer is Big 20, and we can perform the same sort of calculation 11 to the power 20.

75
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,800
So how could we break that down?

76
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:52,720
We could look at 11 to the power of ten and then square that 11 to the power ten where 1717 squared

77
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,210
is 289.

78
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,270
And then that will become 87 MOD 101.

79
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:10,980
Finally we are going to calculate the shared secret X to the power A Times B and that is in mod Q.

80
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,820
Now you could do this by looking at Alices part of the secret first and then using Bob's secret number.

81
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,470
Or you could do that the other way round.

82
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,080
I am going to start with Alice's secret.

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,950
Seems easier, so Alice's part of the secret was three.

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,710
And then we will base that to Bob secret number, which was 23 to the power 20.

85
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,560
Now, I didn't really find an easy way of doing this calculation, but I did it this way.

86
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:45,960
We could break that up as three to the power four to the power five, which could be written as 81 to

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:55,380
the Power five, which in this modulus, which is 101, I'm going to write that as -20 to the power

88
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,010
five.

89
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,690
Then that can be calculated fairly easy because it's a nice round number.

90
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,330
It's -3 million, 200,000.

91
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,870
So that is a big number.

92
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,510
But the modulus is very easy.

93
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,180
So with a bit of work you can actually show that that is congruent to 84 and mod one I want.

94
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,010
And.

95
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:31,420
Why can't we use the generator x equals ten and thus because it will not generate all possible values

96
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,850
in modulo 101.

97
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,420
Just to show that we can look at ten squared.

98
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,580
And that is going to be 100.

99
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,380
In mod one I want.

100
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,360
Ten.

101
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,080
Cute.

102
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,550
It's going to be 91.

103
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,130
In Mod 101.

104
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,990
Ten to the power for.

105
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,620
It's going to be one.

106
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,610
Marge 101 and ten to the power five.

107
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,560
And it turns out to be ten in my 101.

108
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,260
And from there, the pattern will repeat.

109
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,520
So we're not generating all the possible values.

110
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:24,130
Another way to see that is to notice that ten squared, which is 100, is congruent to minus one in

111
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,990
mod 101.

112
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:37,720
So tend to the power for it's going to be coming to minus one squared, which is one in mod 101 and

113
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:46,960
therefore a ten to the power for pn where any some integer that is going to be common to one mod 101

114
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,150
no matter what the integer is.

115
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,690
So again, you're not generating all the possible values there.

116
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,650
Okay.

117
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,260
Next, we're going to be looking at all a.
