1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,980
Now let's take a look at the solutions for this breaking RSA exercises.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,600
I start with a few notes.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,510
First, I say we're going to use two digit numbers now.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,000
So A is 0001, Z is 25.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,880
That just makes things nice and same size.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,810
I say that the following ciphertext contain no padding, which means you can break them using the methods

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,010
I described in the course.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,430
And finally, I say you can perform these calculations with a computer or Wolfram Alpha.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,920
So let's do question one.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,910
And I ask you to encode the word elephant as two digit numbers just to get that point across.

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,980
So elephant is the word.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,870
So elephant.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,830
And then I'm asking you to write us two digit numbers.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,010
So that is zero 411 zero 415

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,970
0700 13 and 19.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:10,750
He split the word into blocks of two letters and write the numerical values of each block.

17
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:21,210
So we are now going to split the word into blocks of two letters e l, e, p, h, a and an t, and

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,050
will write the values of that.

19
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,810
And that is just 0411.

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,860
041507001319.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,150
We are now going to encrypt these blocks using RSA.

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:52,350
With modulus m equals 2773 and encryption key E equals 1147, which is not too hard to do with a computer.

23
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,100
How can you say if a writing hour blocks?

24
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,920
And if not.

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,000
Like that.

26
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,040
We have our numerical values.

27
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,420
04110415.

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,360
07001319.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,930
And now we hit it with the formula p to the power e mode and.

30
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,330
And yes, with our computers we can to say that that is going to be 1816

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,110
1429.

32
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,450
1225.

33
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,110
And 1511.

34
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,680
So those phone numbers will be the ciphertext.

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:50,240
But I want to point out that this hides the frequency of the letter E and it hides that A, which has

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,980
always been zero so far.

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,410
Now it's hiding that A as well.

38
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,390
So now let's have a look at some breaking RSA methods.

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,090
So these were described in the course notes.

40
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,080
Let's take a look.

41
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,880
So we have a stolen ciphertext reading here.

42
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,340
So we've got three numbers here.

43
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:18,710
It was sent using RSA without padding and a public key of M equals 2773 and E equals 1147 is the same

44
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,850
numbers I used before.

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,310
So work out the original message using a chosen plaintext attack.

46
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,510
So we think the ciphertext is one of these four possible words.

47
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,360
So because it's all animal themed, you might be putting mongoose, rabbit or raccoon.

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,920
Which word is it?

49
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:43,940
So really, we just test out these four words using the public key and then see which one matches the

50
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,560
stolen ciphertext.

51
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:52,070
Well, we've got three numbers here, and these are like six letter words or eight letter words.

52
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,060
So they're written in blocks and it's probably a six letter word in blocks of two.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,630
So I'm going to exclude Mongoose straight away.

54
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,160
So a mongoose is too long.

55
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,150
Mongoose is too long.

56
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,840
Now, that would be a problem if it had padding.

57
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,930
If it has padding, then the padding makes all these words the same length, which makes it harder to

58
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,760
work out which one is which.

59
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,350
Now let's test out some of these words baboon, rabbit or raccoon.

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,490
Let's test out the first two letters of rabbit or raccoon because they both start with an R and then

61
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:28,950
A.

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:37,280
So if I encrypt r a, then r a is encoded as 1700.

63
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,710
And let's hit that with the public key.

64
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:52,520
To the public key, we take 1700 raise to the encryption number, 1147, and that is going to be congruent

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,600
to 1015 in March.

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,700
2000 to 773.

67
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,150
There we go.

68
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,370
2773.

69
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,820
That matches the first block of the ciphertext.

70
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,210
So.

71
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,800
Oh, that's a clue.

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,220
So he's not going to be back in I think it's rabbit or it's raccoon, but I'm going to test the next

73
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,620
pair of letters to find out.

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,660
I'm going to use.

75
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,820
Let's try raccoon.

76
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,650
So she used the C oh.

77
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,630
So if I use the C L, I'm going to get 0214.

78
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,490
And I going to hit that.

79
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,150
With the encryption key.

80
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,550
And if I do that, I'm going to get to go for for.

81
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:55,680
In March 2773 AU That matches the second black hour, so it's probably going to be raccoon.

82
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:03,660
And if you wanted to, you could test out B.B. here in Rabbit and you'll find that it will not work.

83
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,250
So if you do that, you test out B.B. it would be 0101.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:20,500
And if we encrypt that with our encryption key, that is going to be 1353.

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,470
But it doesn't match the ciphertext.

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,770
So yes, raccoon sounds right to me.

87
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,790
And indeed, if you keep going, e check out the last block there.

88
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,350
The O and that would be one for.

89
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,110
One three.

90
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,760
And if you encrypt that.

91
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:47,090
No surprises, but it will encrypt to be the final block in the cipher text.

92
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,640
So it is the word raccoon after all.

93
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,360
Okay, so let's have a look at question three.

94
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,610
We've got a stone in ciphertext again.

95
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,380
Those are the values.

96
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,090
I wasn't using RSA without padding and the same public key as before.

97
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,290
This time I've decided to use a chosen ciphertext attack using x equals two.

98
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,930
So first of all, we're going to have a look and see that X in our code prime.

99
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,820
So, okay, prime.

100
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,840
I know what that means.

101
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,710
So we could do have Euclid's algorithm here.

102
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,780
But it's not too hard.

103
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,160
Euclid's algorithm.

104
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,530
So we do that.

105
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,370
So we're looking to show that X and M.

106
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,130
Okay, prime.

107
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,920
That's right.

108
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,750
M which is 2773 on the left.

109
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,300
That is equal to something times two to something.

110
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:52,580
It turns out that the coefficient there is 1386 and the remainder is one.

111
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,880
And that ends Euclid's algorithm straight away for us.

112
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,540
That's nice.

113
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,480
So, yes, they all k prime.

114
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,180
The greatest common divisor will be one.

115
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,370
So what is the multiplicative inverse of X in modulo m?

116
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:16,100
Well, I need to reverse Euclid's algorithm here so that I have one equal some sort of combination of

117
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,100
the original numbers, which is two.

118
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,400
And.

119
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,950
2773.

120
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,770
Well, that's quite easy to reverse.

121
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:40,570
And so that's just one lot of 2773 and subtracting the 1386.

122
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,430
So now it's actually a -1386 there.

123
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,820
So it's that coefficient that will be the inverse.

124
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,140
So if x equals two.

125
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,480
If X equals two, then the inverse, which I'll call x dash.

126
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,910
Is congruent to the -1386, and I could leave it like that, but let's make it positive.

127
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,700
And so I'll just add on the modulus to make it 1387.

128
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,640
Again, that is in MOD 2773.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,950
Let's continue.

130
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,910
So the next part asks you to work out X to the power e in mind.

131
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,430
And so we know what x is.

132
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,830
It's two, we know what E is.

133
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:44,220
It is 1147 and yet use a computer because the answer is going to be 1134 and that's in March.

134
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,840
2773.

135
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,470
Part D then asks you to create a second cipher.

136
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,000
C2, which is C1 multiplied by that value, just worked out.

137
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,490
So, so c1.

138
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,340
Is the ciphertext, which is a178.

139
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,950
1735.

140
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,920
And 0903.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,100
And we're multiplying that to get C to we're multiplying that by the value is just what out the 1134.

142
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,540
And we get.

143
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,350
21961423.

144
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,450
And 0765.

145
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,780
So that is our cipher too, which doesn't mean anything, but that is our fake cipher.

146
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,890
I am now able to have cipher two deciphered and I will receive a decryption which looks like this.

147
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,410
What was the original message?

148
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,300
So we have our 0061.

149
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,760
Our zero 0 to 6.

150
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,870
And 1208.

151
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:13,830
Now, when you have that deciphered, the result is that it's just a plain text multiplied by x and

152
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,510
mod m.

153
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,040
So now to finish off to get the plain text, which is multiply this thing by the X in.

154
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:28,060
So we've taking the line above and then multiply that by x inverse and that's in mod and.

155
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,380
X inverse we worked out, which was the 1387 that was from part B.

156
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,090
So I'm multiplying by that value and I'm doing that in modular arithmetic.

157
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,910
And the final answer is going to be 1417.

158
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,470
0013.

159
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,790
Zero six.

160
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,890
Zero four.

161
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,440
And finally, we turn out two letters.

162
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:06,230
What we get when we turn it into letters, we get o, o, a and g e.

163
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,890
It's a return of the surprise.

164
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,560
Orange.

165
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,280
There you go.

166
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,500
So orange is coming back just like we had at the beginning of this course.

167
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,870
Finally, let's have a look at question for another stone in ciphertext.

168
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,490
So a question for SAS.

169
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,680
Here we have a stolen ciphertext.

170
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,100
It was sent using RSA without padding and the same public key we've had before.

171
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,850
Modulus M equal to 2773 and encryption key E equal to 1147.

172
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:44,380
This time I'm going to ask you to break this cipher by centralising the modulus and working out the

173
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,820
original message.

174
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,290
And I'm not going to give you the solution to this answer.

175
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,130
I'm going to leave this as a challenge.

176
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,900
This was our last question for the course, and I think it would be nice to leave that as a challenge

177
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,160
to our no prizes.

178
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,570
We are playing for glory.

179
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:07,210
But if you do get this answer really well done, you can send me a message if you like, on Udemy,

180
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,670
telling me that you have solved this message and I will send you no prizes whatsoever.

181
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,220
But I will send you some congratulations.

182
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,170
Yes, we're just playing for smugness here, so good luck with that.

183
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,710
So that's the final challenge and that is the final solution video.

184
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,480
So I hope you enjoy the next couple of lecture videos.
