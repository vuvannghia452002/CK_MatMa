1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:08,490
So in our last video, we just saw that we were going to try and create RSA decryption and we saw that

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:18,930
we needed a decryption key that obeyed this rule here where p to the power e times the mod m gets you

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,630
back to your original plaintext letter.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,530
I claim that this exists and I'm going to show you how to find it.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,680
But before we get that, I'm going to need a couple of mathematical results known as Fermat's Little

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,780
Theorem and the Chinese Remainder Theorems.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,850
Let's take a look at these results.

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,930
And these are proper results.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,250
They're actually called theorems, and they actually have names which shows you that they are proper

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,920
mathematical results and important results, too.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,870
So let's start with a famous little theorem named after Ferma.

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,730
You may have heard of Fermat's Last Theorem.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,710
This is Fermat's Little Theorem.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,940
This is a fact about prime numbers.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,220
So it's just a little fact about prime numbers.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,300
Let's see what it is.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,400
So let's take a Q.

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:10,560
If Q is a prime and X an integer, then this is my little fact.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,100
So x integer co prime to Q very important then this is my fact.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,560
X to the power.

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,830
Q minus one is congruent to one mode.

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,490
Q.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,040
Okay.

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,880
Just seems like some mathematical fact.

25
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,540
We're going to prove it, though.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
Let's have a look at the proof of this.

27
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,090
So we've said that X and Q are co prime.

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:52,370
X was our integer and Q was a prime number was in there k prime oh k prime warning bells and I know

29
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,480
what k prime means.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:06,890
It means there exists integers, s and t such that I can write a combination s x plus t q equal one

31
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,740
because one will be their greatest common divisor.

32
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:17,870
So we've got this here x plus two equals one in most Q arithmetic, which is what I'm going to write

33
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,560
down next.

34
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:30,230
T Q would disappear as a multiple of Q is a zero so I can write this is s x congruent to one mod q.

35
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,480
And that means that X has a multiplicative inverse, which is s.

36
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,530
Module IQ.

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,010
In other words, s is the inverse of x.

38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,160
They cancel out, so you get 1ak.

39
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,580
So x that integer has a multiplicative inverse and I've even told you what it is.

40
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,710
It's s next.

41
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:04,770
Imagine we have two multiples of x, here's a multiple and lots of x and let's say that is congruent

42
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,250
to n lots of x mod q.

43
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:18,960
If that occurs, we could multiply both sides by s, which would cancel out the x and you would get

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,010
m congruent to n mod Q.

45
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:31,260
Now that's going to help us because that means no two items in this list can be congruent.

46
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,630
So what?

47
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,460
What is the list?

48
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:44,370
x2x3x you get the idea for x, etc. up to two minus one x.

49
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:53,070
None of those values can be congruent in modulo Q because they've all got different coefficients of

50
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,610
x.

51
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,570
This means the list is just this list and written in a different way.

52
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,700
This means the list is simply what are the remainders in March?

53
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,930
Q It's 1 to 3 dot, dot, dot.

54
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,230
Q Minus one in modulo.

55
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,220
Q although possibly in a different order.

56
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,440
So it might not be exactly the same list in the same order, but it is the same list.

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,440
If both lists are the same, multiplying all the terms in each list gives this right.

58
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,120
Let's do this.

59
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,740
I'm going to multiply this list first.

60
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,180
The first list we had with the x2x3x, multiply everything together.

61
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,090
So what are going to get?

62
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,220
We're going to get one X times two X times three x.

63
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:52,120
All the coefficients are going to be one times, two times three times four, optically minus one,

64
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,390
which is Q minus one factorial.

65
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,930
And would I know the x is together x times x times x times x is q minus one.

66
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,370
Lots of x.

67
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,260
I'm going to write that as.

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,650
X to the power.

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:17,350
Q minus one written it that way and that is congruent to and multiplying everything together on the

70
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,000
second list because it's the same list.

71
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,310
So I'm going to multiply all these values together on the second, which is this one times, two times,

72
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,890
three times optically minus one, which is Q minus one factorial.

73
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:38,830
And remember this was all in mod q arithmetic since Q is prime.

74
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,860
It is co prime to all integers, 1 to 3, optically minus one.

75
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,680
And it is co prime to a number like that, then that number would have an inverse and you could be able

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,270
to cancel it out to get rid of it.

77
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,480
Therefore, we can cancel out these factorial.

78
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:07,250
So we can cancel out the term Q minus one factorial on both sides.

79
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,810
And then this leaves what we get.

80
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,290
So we just cancel out the key minus one factorial.

81
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,820
We would get X to the power.

82
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,190
Q minus one is congruent to one.

83
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,900
What Q?

84
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,610
And again, which is.

85
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
And the proof.

86
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,060
That is what I was trying to prove.

87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,940
That is fair analysis.

88
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,590
Say that as it stands, you don't see what we're going to do with this yet.

89
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,350
But let's take it let's just have a look at an example of the market to fail and let's use some numbers

90
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,370
to see it working as take x equals four.

91
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,500
As an integer and a prime.

92
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,310
Let's take a q equals five.

93
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,840
Then let's take a look at well, what does firm R0 Theorem say?

94
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:08,770
Says Take X, which is four to the power Q minus one s five minus one which is going to be four to the

95
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,720
powerful minus.

96
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:19,060
Well, write that in it's equal to four to the power four and that is equal to 256.

97
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:30,940
But here's the important thing that is congruent to one mod five, and that is not a coincidence.

98
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,570
That was a conclusion guaranteed by Fermi's Little Theorem.

99
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,690
That's exactly what I was expecting by firm Little Theorem.

100
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,400
And it wasn't a coincidence.

101
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,840
It's guaranteed to happen.

102
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,630
That would always happen under no circumstances.

103
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,620
Fair Master two Theorem Our Next Theorem.

104
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,530
I'm going to be straight on our next theorem again.

105
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,860
Cool theory with a name Chinese remainder theorem for this one if.

106
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,800
A is congruent to be marked and.

107
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,730
And a is congruent to be mod n.

108
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,850
So we've got two conferences here.

109
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,050
So if that is true with M and N.

110
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,380
Co prime integers, so they are co prime integers.

111
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,590
Then here's our conclusion.

112
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,170
A is congruent to be marked m times end.

113
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:45,590
So if you have a congruence that is true modern and a congruent that is true mod n with these modulus

114
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:55,700
values k prime then the congruent is still true in mod m and I will prove that proof.

115
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,150
This take and a is congruent.

116
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,620
Let's just take our set up really a is going to be modem.

117
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,300
And a.

118
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,730
Congruent to be model then.

119
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:24,060
Now we go way back to our definition of modular arithmetic and from the definition of modular take.

120
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,330
I can tell you there exists integers that's called in K1 and K2.

121
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:40,890
I'll put it here in this gap such that the difference of A and B is a multiple of the modulus.

122
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,950
So in our case we have a minus.

123
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,220
B is equal to k1m.

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,390
And A minus B is equal to K to N.

125
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,940
That is the definition of modular arithmetic.

126
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,510
So yeah, well, A-minus B here and A minus B here.

127
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,940
So I can just say these things are equal.

128
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,590
k1m is equal to k to n.

129
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,950
Okay.

130
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,190
Therefore m strictly divides k to n.

131
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:33,260
Yes, this K2 n is a multiple of m and strictly divides K2 n, but since m.

132
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,860
An n r code prime.

133
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:44,530
That means M doesn't divide and it must divide q.

134
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,800
This means m strictly divides k to.

135
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,220
And therefore there exists another integer, let's call it K three.

136
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:04,730
There exists an integer k three such that k two is equal to k3m.

137
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,300
So K2 is a multiple of em as well.

138
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,920
And finally, we can conclude A minus B.

139
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,440
It's equal to K to N.

140
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:30,010
I know that from what one of the second line here in the proof that it is but k two can be replaced

141
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:41,860
now with k3m so this is equal to k three and N and that's it really because that is the definition of

142
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,610
a congruent to B mod.

143
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,940
M n and the proof.

144
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,620
Very good.

145
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,280
So that is, Chinese remained there.

146
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,940
So now we've got that in our pocket.

147
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,470
We've got that under our belt.

148
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:04,700
And we're going to use these two results in what's coming up next, which is finding how to decrypt

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,660
RSA.

150
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:11,270
So this decryption result is what we call a corollary.

151
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,870
It's an easy consequence of a theorem or proposition.

152
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,920
As I say, decryption is a corollary of the results.

153
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,670
We've just done.

154
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,150
Fantastic.

155
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,130
And the Chinese remained a theorem.

156
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,510
And I think we'll take a proper look at this in the next video.
