1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,170
It's time to take a look at the solutions for the RSA exercises.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,740
And I start with a note saying that you are perfectly welcome to use a computer to work out these computations.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,990
I recommend Wolfram Alpha dot com and that is exactly what I used when doing these calculations myself.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,260
So there is no reason why you can't do that as well.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,860
So we're going to encrypt the word lie in using RSA with modulus m equal 1241 and encryption key E equals

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,290
five and the result will be four numbers.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,940
So let's take a look at that.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,530
So Lyon is the word.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:47,700
Going back to our animal names and we write that in numbers L becomes an 11, I becomes an eight oh,

10
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,240
becomes a 14 and becomes a 13.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,980
And then what is the formula we're going to use when it's P to the power E and that is Mount M?

12
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,980
Like I said, I just use Wolfram Alpha for this.

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,990
And these were the values I got.

14
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,560
So 962 502.

15
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,160
471 and 234.

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,680
And that would be the ciphertext.

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,170
Let's take a look at question two.

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,850
We want to create an RSA scheme with two primes, Q1 and Q2, which are 23 and 179.

19
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,350
What is the modulus?

20
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:38,360
The modulus means multiplying those two primes together 23 times 179, and that is going to be 4117.

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,660
Using the scheme, calculate the value for a.

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,650
If you remember a is taking away one from each prime.

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,040
So we're looking at 23 minus one and multiplying that by 179 minus one.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:01,610
And if we do that, that's 22 times 278 that that is equal to 3916.

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,370
And now using this scheme, what is the smallest possible choice of encryption key e.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,150
So the important thing about the encryption key.

27
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,520
It must be prime to a.

28
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,710
That's right.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,130
That in.

30
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:29,890
And what is a well, a is 3916, which if you break that down into its factors, it's two squared times

31
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,860
11 times 89.

32
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,620
So a good value for E would be equals three.

33
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,740
It is k prime and also it would be the smallest k prime value.

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,520
Perfect.

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,900
So this is using RSA and the smallest encryption key, encrypt the word forger.

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,590
So here we go.

37
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,730
Say the word is badger.

38
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,370
Be a d, g, e, r, which we are writing as numbers.

39
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,200
That is 136 417.

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,750
I know we're using our RSA formula, which is pizza power, a mod and.

41
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,840
And a lot of these are quite easy to work out because they're small numbers.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:25,060
The E is three, so we're keeping these numbers to be one, a 0 to 27, a 216, we get a 64 and then

43
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,030
the only difficult one is the 17 cubed.

44
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,590
But I will tell you that the answer will be 796, and that's in mud and arithmetic.

45
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
So that is the final answer.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,460
That will be your ciphertext.

47
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,940
Let's take a look at the next questions.

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,590
So question three.

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
Decrypt these numbers.

50
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:55,100
So we've got our ciphertext numbers using RSA with modulus m equals 187 and a decryption key D equals

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,550
three.

52
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,460
And then we should get letters of the alphabet.

53
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,660
We should get a message back.

54
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,420
So really this is the same procedure.

55
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:11,000
And if I write down the numbers first, it's the same procedure as before and we just using a decrypt

56
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,200
number now.

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,760
So we hit it with our formula is P to the power D in mod m and being 187.

58
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:32,750
And if we do that again, I just used Wolfram Alpha and we had 1914, 22, zero 13 and then that can

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,870
get turned into letters and it is t u c and it is two can.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,090
Let's have a look at questions four and five.

61
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,410
We want to create an RSA scheme with two primes.

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,990
Q One is 60, 61 and.

63
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,060
Q two is 223.

64
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,230
What is the modulus?

65
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,460
The modulus is multiplying the primes together.

66
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:07,160
And we will get a modulus of 13,603 using this scheme.

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,240
Calculate the value of A to A equals.

68
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,230
61 minus one multiplied by 223 minus one.

69
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,730
So 60 times 222.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:30,250
So that is going to be 13,320 if the encryption key is quite big.

71
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,820
Number 1903, what is the decryption key?

72
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,130
So to do this, we need to know a formula.

73
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,100
We need to work out an expression of this.

74
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:54,070
Form one equals three times E plus t, a, and then B here the coefficient of E will be the decryption

75
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,520
key.

76
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,450
And that can be done with Euclid's algorithm.

77
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,300
There it is again.

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,920
So let's have a go at that.

79
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,650
So using Euclid's algorithm, first of all, we're going to put our values for a on the left hand side

80
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:12,730
is Y 13,320, and that is going to be equal to make something.

81
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:23,730
Times 1903 plus something and that sort of thing here turns out to be a sexist coefficient and a remainder

82
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,680
of 1902.

83
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:35,670
And now if you shift things across 1903 is equal to you can be one lot of 1902 plus one.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,640
Not actually ends Euclid's algorithm already.

85
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,290
That's nice.

86
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:50,190
And now we reversed that so that we can write one is equal to 1903 -1902.

87
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,990
And we'll just replace.

88
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
1902.

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,790
With the previous line which was replaced 1902.

90
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,280
Replace it with 13,320 minus six.

91
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,520
Lots of 1903.

92
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:19,900
And we clean this up so we'll have a plus six, lots of 1903 plus the one we had at the beginning.

93
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,260
So that is a plus seven lots.

94
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Of 1903 minus the 13,320.

95
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,100
And is this coefficient in front of the 1903, which was the encryption key?

96
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,580
So a d is equal to seven.

97
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,730
I gave you a relatively small number to work with that.

98
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,290
So we're going to use that decryption key now to decrypt our final, final ciphertext, which is here.

99
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,260
So let's do that.

100
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,000
So it's these numbers.

101
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,430
12,521.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,190
12,397.

103
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,580
10,139 and 99.

104
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,030
And we're going to use our decryption key.

105
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,720
So each of our data is now seven in model.

106
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:20,600
And we worked out in part A and if we do that again, I just used a computer to do it.

107
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,400
It was 15, 14, 13 and 24.

108
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,300
And that will be give us a P, o and Y.

109
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,400
I've given you a pony.

110
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,930
How nice.

111
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,750
And finally, question five.

112
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,880
Same idea, really?

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,290
Just with hard numbers.

114
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,490
So question five.

115
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,730
We want to create an RSA scheme with these primes.

116
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,440
So slightly bigger primes now.

117
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,930
Hundred 13 257.

118
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,380
The modulus is multiplying those together.

119
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,990
Which if we do multiply those together, it's 29,041 a.

120
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,770
Means subtracting one from each prime and multiplying that together.

121
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,810
Which if we do, that will give us a value.

122
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,470
28,672.

123
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,610
And now we've got an encryption key, which is this 18,847.

124
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,770
What is the decryption key?

125
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,190
Same method as before.

126
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,640
Just larger numbers.

127
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,340
And it can be done with Euclid's algorithm.

128
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,410
So we're going to use Euclid's algorithm exactly the same way as before to calculate this.

129
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,890
The answer actually has one, two, three, four, five, six steps in it, and then you reverse those.

130
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,950
I'm not going to write them out just for brevity, but the complete solution is in the resources with

131
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,670
this video.

132
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:54,400
So I will just skip to the end and tell you that after reversing Euclid's algorithm, you get one equals

133
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,880
607 multiplied by the 18,847

134
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:10,780
-399, multiplied by the value for a which is the 28,000.

135
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,710
672.

136
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:24,760
And it's the coefficient here in front of E which is 607, so D equals 607.

137
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,440
That is your decrypt key.

138
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,710
And then I do ask you to decrypt a message.

139
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,250
Using that decryption key.

140
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,650
And if we do that, well, there's no surprises here.

141
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,410
So these are our numbers.

142
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,710
And we are going to use the computer to help us out.

143
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,690
And there is a zero there.

144
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,850
So that should be a correlate.

145
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,210
And if I just write in these numbers.

146
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,650
Yes.

147
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:07,800
Our formula is just as before because the decryption key is 607 and we get 15 four zero 13.

148
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,800
20 and 19.

149
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,900
What do we get?

150
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,740
We get p e a.

151
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,490
And you two.

152
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,650
Yeah, we got peanut.

153
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,880
How nice.

154
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,190
Okay, so that is our essay.

155
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,850
And next, we'll be looking at breaking RSA.
