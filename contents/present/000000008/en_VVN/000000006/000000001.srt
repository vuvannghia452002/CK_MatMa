1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,350
Now it's time to bring our story up to date with modern Internet encryption.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,330
I talked about having that locked box idea and sending your message to your friend.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:17,190
Now, I said that the code breaker, the spy could brute force this open to smashing the box open.

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,560
I talked about picking the lock.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,560
And I also talked about someone stealing the key.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,230
So this is going to be another way of preventing people from stealing the key because we're not going

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,060
to give out any keys.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,370
So this is called public key cryptography.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,110
So let's go to our notes and we'll have a look at our first example of this.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,360
We'll start with just a little introduction here.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:48,030
So a cipher system is symmetric or one key if it is easy to reduce the decryption key from the encryption

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,420
key.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,630
In practice, these two keys are often identical.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,930
So that's kind of what we've been seeing so far.

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,890
So something like an additive cipher, multiplicative cipher, or even a general substitution cipher.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,430
You can work out the inverse key from the original key.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,500
This creates the problem of exchanging keys without the keys being stolen.

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,020
So if you are the spy and you steal the key, then you will be able to decode the messages to solve

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,620
this problem.

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,850
Two schemes were developed that don't require any secret channels.

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,600
You don't have to exchange keys in any sort of secret way.

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,720
So this is known as public key cryptography.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,720
So there are no secrets involved.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,260
You can just give away the keys.

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,730
The first was devised by Diffie and Hellman in 1976, and the second was devised by Rivest Shamir and

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,010
Adelman in 1977.

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,370
We're going to describe both these ideas, along with some small examples, but the first that we're

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,790
going to look at is the Diffie Hellman Key Exchange.

29
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:03,360
So the idea with this one is you both create the two participants, both create part of a shared key.

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,880
So they start with a shared base.

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,610
The first person creates part of the key.

32
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,980
The second person creates part of the key.

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,230
They then exchange what they've made.

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,600
They both then complete the key.

35
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,570
And those two participants will have a complete key each which they can use for sending each of other

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,500
messages.

37
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,130
But then if you have the spy who wants to steal the keys, well, you're sending only partial keys backwards

38
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,700
and forwards.

39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,570
So that's the idea.

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,940
But we'll do that in a more mathematical way.

41
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,830
So the idea of Diffie Hellman Key Exchange is to create, like I said, a shared key, starting with

42
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,820
a shared base.

43
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:48,240
Each participant makes a partial key, which are then exchanged and used to complete the final shared

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,600
key.

45
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,430
Here are or here is an example using exponents where all exchanges can be made on an insecure channel.

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,570
So you can pass this information backwards and forwards in public.

47
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:10,710
So let Q be a prime key for a prime instead of P for prime, because we used plot already for plaintext

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,130
letters.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,710
So Q is a prime number.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:26,970
Then there exists an integer x, right, such that the powers of x generate all values modulo q.

51
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,970
So that's just something that is true.

52
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,450
I'm giving this to you as a fact.

53
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:38,670
So when you're working in modulo Q arithmetic and Q is a prime, then there will be an integer that

54
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,420
can then generate all the possible values modulo Q which if you remember all the possible remainders

55
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:54,540
modulo Q So step one of this key exchange you've got Alyson Bob as they as we traditionally have.

56
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,530
And first of all, they share their common information.

57
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,800
And common information is it's a modulus of.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,560
Q So you can tell people what that number is and the generator.

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,770
X Again, you can tell people what that is.

60
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,390
Then step two Alice has a secret integer and we'll call that a a for Alice.

61
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,480
And Alice will calculate this value X to the power.

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,910
A So it's X to the power.

63
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:34,260
A So we're talking about X times, x times X a number of times, and that will be in modern Q arithmetic.

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,600
So you'll have a smaller number than not because and most Q arithmetic means you look at the remainder.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,030
And Bob will do the same.

66
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:52,910
Bob has a secret integer B for Bob and calculates using that generator that everyone knows using x.

67
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,130
Raising to the power b this time.

68
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,670
And that is in mod q arithmetic.

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,470
So Alice and Bob have made partial keys and they now swap.

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,110
So they swap those partial keys.

71
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:15,260
And then finally Alice is going to calculate X to the power B that is Bob's partial key and raise that

72
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:22,670
to Alice's secret number, which is a switch X to the power B to the power A and that will be mod Q.

73
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,360
And Bob.

74
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,890
Well, Bob takes Odyssey's partial key, which is exit the power aid and raises to his secret number.

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,690
So brazen to Power B.

76
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,700
Now we've got X to the power, eh?

77
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,750
To the power B, and that is a mod Q arithmetic.

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,690
So that's what is in Bob have done.

79
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,790
But this is great because they have created a shared key.

80
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,340
This is a shared key because.

81
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:01,070
X to the power A to the power B is going to be congruent to.

82
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:09,900
I put this in a bracket now x the power of B to the power a mod q is going to mean that I was in power

83
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,750
will now have the same value.

84
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,450
They're going to have the same numerical value which they will be able to use to encrypt and decrypt

85
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:17,820
messages.

86
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,890
This is only the key.

87
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,590
This is not sending the message itself.

88
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,920
So he's now created a number and they both got the same number and then they can use that in whatever

89
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,230
cipher they've decided to use.

90
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,180
And it might be something simple.

91
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,170
It might be something like a multiplicative cipher.

92
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:43,400
That is what some of the code l gammel encryption uses this idea and then takes that secret number they've

93
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:51,740
created in a multiplicative cipher, using this as a multiplicative key in modulo Q.

94
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,880
It's a split in that last gap that so it doesn't even have to be a difficult cipher once you've exchanged

95
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,570
the key.

96
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,440
Okay, let's do an example of this with some small numbers so that you get a better feel for it.

97
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:16,190
So let's take an X to be two, X equals two and we'll have a prime number, and that is Q And that is

98
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:22,760
going to be, I'm going to say 29 as my prime number, starting with this base.

99
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,370
So that is public information that everyone can know.

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,870
The two participants use the secret integers.

101
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:38,600
Let's say Alice has picked a equals five and Bob has picked B equals 12 and they're going to create

102
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,920
their partial keys.

103
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,480
So what does that mean?

104
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,980
So they take the generator, which is two, and I'm going to do Alice first.

105
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:53,840
So two to the power A, which is five and that will be well we can just calculate that if you want to.

106
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,670
That is equal to 32.

107
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:08,120
So two to the power five and we're in March 29 arithmetic here that is congruent to three Mar 29 arithmetic

108
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,590
because there is three left over and what is Bob going to do?

109
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,930
So I'll end here and then Bob.

110
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:23,690
Bob is taking that generator to raising two secret number 12 and he's going to create something quite

111
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,130
large actually that in this case 4096.

112
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,030
And then we're interested in that value.

113
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:40,610
In my 29 arithmetic, which I will tell you right now, is a seven mod 29.

114
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,880
You can get a calculator, a computer to work that out, but I am going to show you methods of working

115
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,280
out something like that for yourself by hand.

116
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,750
But now we are going to exchange those values.

117
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,000
So Alice and Bob exchange their values.

118
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:05,020
Alice receives Bob's value and it was seven and will raise seven to hash secret number, which is a

119
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,050
five.

120
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,670
So it's to the power five.

121
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,970
And then that is something I'm going to tell you what it is.

122
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:20,930
16,807 and we go and was that in mod 29 arithmetic?

123
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:29,150
Again, just let me tell you, it is congruent to 16 mod 29 and what's Bob going to do?

124
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:38,900
So Bob has received Alice's number, which was a three, and that's going to be raised to the power

125
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,540
12, and that is whether it's going to be equal to a very large number,

126
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,660
531,441.

127
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,220
And again, I will tell you that that is congruent to 16 March 29, which is nice because you get the

128
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,980
same number as we expected to.

129
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:09,410
The two participants now have a shared key of 16, and they can use that however they want in whatever

130
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,250
cipher they want.

131
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:18,530
Now, in real life, the values of A, B and Q are much larger.

132
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:26,840
So when you're really using this procedure, you will be using larger values of A, B and Q.

133
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,630
You're going to get some very large numbers in these calculations.

134
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,170
Again, you could do these with computers and things, however, and when I was taught how to do modular

135
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:42,320
arithmetic in this kind of thing, and I was taught how to do it by hand because we didn't really have

136
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,420
the computers around to do this for us.

137
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,480
And yeah, so I'm going to teach you how to do it by hand.

138
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,820
So often you can do this by hand if you notice by observation.

139
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:00,360
And some sort of way to break up the calculation so that some parts of the calculation are easy numbers,

140
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:08,760
like small numbers, so that some parts of the calculation become zero mod, whatever one might, whatever

141
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,920
or two might, whatever it is.

142
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,560
Those zeros, ones and twos then obviously are very easy to start calculating.

143
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,380
I'll show you an example of how you might do that.

144
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,560
So this is you trying to do something by hand.

145
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
So to calculate to to the power.

146
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,180
12 March 29.

147
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,050
So what I'm not going to do I'm not going to calculate to to the power 12 but I might notice by observation

148
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,160
something that is easy to use.

149
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:49,770
Maybe I'll see that two to the power five which is 32 that is congruent to three Mar 29.

150
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,840
And then there's two to the power 12.

151
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:05,750
We could break it up to to the power 12 and that is equal to if you are happy with how powers work,

152
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:12,380
we could break up the two to the power 12 into two to the power five squared.

153
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,440
Due to the power five squared is two to power ten.

154
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,770
And what's this over two squared.

155
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,810
And that would be two to power 12.

156
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,510
So I've broken it up and I can replace because it's modular arithmetic, I can replace two to the power

157
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:35,990
five with this much nicer number three so that two, two power five in the bracket is now three.

158
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,710
So it's three squared and two squared.

159
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,040
So I'll just leave us two squared for now.

160
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,490
But obviously that is four.

161
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,370
And so that then is congruent to three squared times two squared.

162
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:58,430
So we can do that however you want nine times four and that then becomes 36.

163
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:07,600
Much more manageable and then that is congruent to seven mod 29, which is what we expected.

164
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,310
That is what I had before.

165
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,340
So yes, you can do these things by hand.

166
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,470
Again, it is really just by observation.

167
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,790
So you just sort of notice some easy numbers and then break up the calculation.

168
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,390
Even though x.

169
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,760
Q and extra power a mod q.

170
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,380
An X to the power of B mod q are sent in the clear.

171
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,260
So on an insecure channel you just you can just exchange these numbers and everyone can find them if

172
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,890
they want to.

173
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,970
It's still very difficult for your spy or codebreaker to work out what X to do.

174
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:57,340
Power A, B mod q will be, which is the shared key.

175
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:04,030
It's very difficult to work that out from the information you've stolen, and this is called the discrete,

176
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,970
logarithmic or logarithm problem.

177
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:16,390
That is a hard thing to solve, which is why we can use it at the procedure created a shared key because

178
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,140
the order of the exponents didn't matter and in other words they commute.

179
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,470
We talked about computing before we talk about computing ciphers.

180
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,210
This is kind of the same idea.

181
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,520
Although we're not committing to ciphers here, we're using a procedure that commits to create the shared

182
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,880
key.

183
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,050
So the order of exponents, I don't matter.

184
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,040
They can mute.

185
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,540
And you could use this same idea with any other procedure that has some element that can meet.

186
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,640
So you could replace exponents with any operation that commutes.

187
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,780
So here's an example.

188
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,140
Nothing like the exponents, and it's called elliptic curve cryptography, which is something we use

189
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,880
today on the internet.

190
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,400
And so to exchange keys.

191
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:07,780
So elliptic curve cryptography uses curves with our own kind of addition.

192
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:15,940
Adding two points on the curve is defined to be the operation of drawing a straight line through the

193
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:22,420
points, finding where the line intersects on the curve, and then reflecting that point in the x axis.

194
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,880
Let me just break down for I said there.

195
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,340
So this is called an electric curve.

196
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,750
There's a picture there underneath.

197
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,970
So it's this wiggly curve.

198
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,030
So a particular kind of mathematical curve.

199
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:42,760
And I've got 2.2, I've got point Q on point R and I've drawn a line through Q and on and intersects

200
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,120
the curve one more time at a third point.

201
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,020
There it is.

202
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,700
And I, what I do next is I actually reflect that in the x axis.

203
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,490
So I actually get a point down here and I call that point Q plus R.

204
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:05,740
Now, this rather strange definition of addition does work a lot like the addition you would know,

205
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,850
and importantly it would commute as well.

206
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:18,070
So, yes, importantly, this definition of addition can meet multiples of a point, can be found quickly

207
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,980
by combination of doubling and addition.

208
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:27,100
So let's say I want you to work out a multiple of Q so I've got my Q here and if I want to work out

209
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,880
a multiple Okay.

210
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,470
Well, first thing I could do is double it.

211
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:38,620
So I'd have Q plus Q would mean drawing a line here through Q itself and then it would intersect.

212
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,230
So probably quite high up over here, I would intersect and create a point to.

213
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:52,600
Q Then I could double to get four Q and I could double for Q and get eight Q So it's very easy to double

214
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,060
that point, and then I could work out multiples of Q using those values.

215
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:06,580
And if I wanted to work out ten lots of Q, I would take eight plus two lots of Q, add those together

216
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:13,690
with this operation so we can find multiples of a point by doubling and then adding.

217
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,930
Now we're going to create a key.

218
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,630
So this is the same idea as Stephanie Hellman, but using this elliptic curve.

219
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:30,490
So the two participants, they're going to start by sharing a starting point, which I'm going to call

220
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,190
P capital P, so they share a starting point, common knowledge.

221
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,740
They know the curve, they know the starting point.

222
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,450
Each participant then create a secret multiple of P.

223
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,260
So let's say we have our Alison Bob.

224
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:57,730
Alice creates a lots of P and Bob creates B, lots of P, so some multiple of that a point which are

225
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,480
then exchanged.

226
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,550
So they swap those points.

227
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:10,780
Both participants, they multiply those exchanged points by their secret value to create a point A,

228
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:18,490
B, P, and the coordinates of that point can be used as the shared key.

229
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,650
So you get a value using the coordinates.

230
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,660
At that point, you can then use that value as a key.

231
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,380
Again, it could be in any other site that you want, could be a multiple.

232
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,430
Negative cipher fi, something like that.

233
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,850
It's very difficult to work out the final point from this information that is exchanged.

234
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,090
So information that is public is the electric curve.

235
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,850
The starting point is public information.

236
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:51,290
Then if you're a spy, you might steal a lots of P and be lots of P, but even with that stolen information

237
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,310
at that final point is very difficult to work out.

238
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,140
And this is even harder if the calculations are done in modular arithmetic.

239
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:06,170
So the way I've described it so far, I've done it with a curve, like like a graph, like a curve you

240
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,030
might see on a graph.

241
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:14,450
I bet you could do all these calculations in modular arithmetic as well, so they wouldn't be a nice

242
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,930
continuous curve like that, but it would be the same sort of idea just in modular arithmetic, and

243
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,200
that would make the point seem completely unrelated.

244
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:31,280
You're just exchanging what seems like random points, very difficult then to work out your shared key.

245
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,630
So that's tricky.

246
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,900
Hellman Exchange a brilliant idea and it is used today to exchange keys.

247
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,380
But next, I'm going to show you another idea that is used again, public key cryptography.

248
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,720
Another example of that, and that is called RSA, are also used on the Internet.

249
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,820
Well, have a look at that in the next video.
